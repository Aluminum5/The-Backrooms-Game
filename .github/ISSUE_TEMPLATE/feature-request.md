## Description
What do you want in the game? Let your imagination bloom!

**Only things on the [wiki](http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/) are allowed. I want to make this game original. If you want a custom thing in the game, [fork this project](https://github.com/EntityPlantt/The-Backrooms-Game/fork) or [add it on the wiki](http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/system:join) and open this issue again.
